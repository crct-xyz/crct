## Directory to repos of working projects

This repository consolidates all the projects and services developed for the CRCT application.
It is designed to provide a single location for review in the Radar Hackathon of our microservices and
web application architecture. Each service remains modular to facilitate independent development and deployment,
yet together they form the backbone of the CRCT platform.
